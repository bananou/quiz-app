# Quiz App

This project demonstrates how to build a quiz application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The quiz app allows users to add multiple questions with four answer choices each. Based on the user's selection,
the app provides immediate feedback by changing the background color of the answer button.

## How It Works

- **Add Questions**: You can add multiple questions, each with four answer choices.
- **Answer Selection**: When you select an answer, the button's background color will change:
  - **Green**: Indicates the correct answer.
  - **Red**: Indicates an incorrect answer.
- **Answer Locking**: Once an answer is selected, it cannot be changed. You can only proceed to the next question.

## Display Quiz Score

- **Score Display**: After submitting the answer to the last question and clicking the next button, the app will display the user's score.

## Features
